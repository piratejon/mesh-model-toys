Daydreaming about wireless mesh networks in JavaScript.

About
=====
Here I want to model some ideas about mesh networks. I picked JavaScript/browser-based since I don't know what kind of computers my friends have but I want them to be able to play along too. If I get something to where I like it I'll just rewrite it in C since garbage collecting terrifies me even though I have 32GB RAM. I'll add some more details as I get further along. Right now it just populates a quadtree and draws it on a canvas.

New Stuff
=========
I learned/used-for-the-first-time the following in this project:

ducking-robot -- this is what Github actually suggested I name this project's repository in an attempt to lend "inspiration"! No one actually better call it that!
