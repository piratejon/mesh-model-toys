Daydreaming about wireless mesh networks in JavaScript.

About
=====
Here I want to model some ideas about mesh networks. I picked JavaScript/browser-based since I don't know what kind of computers my friends have but I want them to be able to play along too. If I get something to where I like it I'll just rewrite it in C since garbage collecting terrifies me even though I have 32GB RAM.

New Stuff
=========
I learned/used-for-the-first-time the following in this project:
* QuadTrees
* Canvas
