TODO:
Self-balancing quadtree (K-d trees?) or some kind of nice structure that lets us efficiently insert, move, and, find neighbors within a given radius -- right now it pretty much does a linear search :(
Moar algorithms:
  * Individual node building a map of the network
    - possibly other nodes will be maintaining their own map and will update when you update and vice versa

Save random seed so we can generate the same map

DONE:
Add properties defined by code defined by user form
